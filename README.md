My group developed and evaluated distributed control protocols for a multi-agent magnetic levitation system. Designed two control algorithms: one using local observers and the other based on a distributed  neighborhood observer, enabling cooperative leader tracking. Simulations assessed system performance across various topologies (mesh, ring) and signal types (constant, ramp, sinusoidal), while also analyzing noise effects and optimizing coupling gains for improved system resilience and energy efficiency.
