My group developed advanced algorithms for secure state estimation and target localization in cyber-physical systems (CPS), using the Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) for LASSO problem-solving. The project
focused on detecting and mitigating sensor attacks to ensure accurate target tracking in dynamic environments. My group implemented a sparse observer for real-time tracking under adversarial conditions, enhancing system resilience,
with distributed processing to achieve consensus among network nodes, ensuring robustness and security in decentralized systems.
